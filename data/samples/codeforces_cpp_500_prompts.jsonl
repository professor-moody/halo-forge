The rules are simple: anyone having finished their soup leaves the circle.\n\nKatie suddenly notices that whenever a cat leaves, the place where she was sitting becomes an empty space, which means the circle is divided into smaller continuous groups of cats sitting next to each other. At the moment Katie observes, there are $$$m$$$ cats who left the circle. This raises a question for Katie: what is the maximum possible number of groups the circle is divided into at the moment?\n\nCould you help her with this curiosity?\n\nYou can see the examples and their descriptions with pictures in the \"Note\" section.\n\nInput Format:\nThe only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 1000$$$, $$$0 \\leq m \\leq n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the initial number of cats at the party and the number of cats who left the circle at the moment Katie observes, respectively.\n\nOutput Format:\nPrint a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximum number of groups of cats at the moment Katie observes."}

For example, a citizen could say \"I live in three passages from the ringroad\" and another one could reply \"you loser, I live in one passage from the ringroad\". The Internet soon got filled with applications that promised to count the distance from the station to the ringroad (send a text message to a short number...).\n\nThe Berland government decided to put an end to these disturbances and start to control the situation. You are requested to write a program that can determine the remoteness from the ringroad for each station by the city subway scheme.\n\nInput Format:\nThe first line contains an integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 3000), n is the number of stations (and trains at the same time) in the subway scheme. Then n lines contain descriptions of the trains, one per line. Each line contains a pair of integers xi, yi (1 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 n) and represents the presence of a passage from station xi to station yi. The stations are numbered from 1 to n in an arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that xi \u2260 yi and that no pair of stations contain more than one passage. The passages can be used to travel both ways. It is guaranteed that the given description represents a classic subway scheme.\n\nOutput Format:\nPrint n numbers. Separate the numbers by spaces, the i-th one should be equal to the distance of the i-th station from the ringroad. For the ringroad stations print number 0."}

Unfortunately, Sam was horrified to see that the hay blocks had been carelessly scattered around the barn. The place was a complete mess. As it turned out, thieves had sneaked into the barn. They completely dissembled and took away a layer of blocks from the parallelepiped's front, back, top and sides. As a result, the barn only had a parallelepiped containing (A - 1) \u00d7 (B - 2) \u00d7 (C - 2) hay blocks. To hide the evidence of the crime, the thieves had dissembled the parallelepiped into single 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 blocks and scattered them around the barn. After the theft Sam counted n hay blocks in the barn but he forgot numbers A, B \u0438 C.\n\nGiven number n, find the minimally possible and maximally possible number of stolen hay blocks.\n\nInput Format:\nThe only line contains integer n from the problem's statement (1 \u2264 n \u2264 109).\n\nOutput Format:\nPrint space-separated minimum and maximum number of hay blocks that could have been stolen by the thieves.\n\nNote that the answer to the problem can be large enough, so you must use the 64-bit integer type for calculations. Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator."}

Let's define the character on the vertex $$$x$$$ as $$$s_x$$$.\n\nLet the preorder string of some vertex $$$x$$$ be defined in the following way:\n\n- if the vertex $$$x$$$ is a leaf, then the preorder string of $$$x$$$ be consisting of only one character $$$s_x$$$;\n- otherwise, the preorder string of $$$x$$$ is $$$s_x + f(l_x) + f(r_x)$$$, where $$$+$$$ operator defines concatenation of strings, $$$f(l_x)$$$ is the preorder string of the left child of $$$x$$$, and $$$f(r_x)$$$ is the preorder string of the right child of $$$x$$$.\n\nThe preorder string of the tree is the preorder string of its root.\n\nNow, for the problem itself...\n\nYou have to calculate the number of different strings that can be obtained as the preorder string of the given tree, if you are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times before constructing the preorder string of the tree:\n\n- choose any non-leaf vertex $$$x$$$, and swap its children (so, the left child becomes the right one, and vice versa).\n\nInput Format:\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 18$$$).\n\nThe second line contains a sequence of $$$2^n-1$$$ characters $$$s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_{2^n-1}$$$. Each character is either A or B. The characters are not separated by spaces or anything else.\n\nOutput Format:\nPrint one integer \u2014 the number of different strings that can be obtained as the preorder string of the given tree, if you can apply any number of operations described in the statement. Since it can be very large, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$."}

{"prompt": "The mythic world of Chess Land is a rectangular grid of squares with $$$R$$$ rows and $$$C$$$ columns, $$$R$$$ being greater than or equal to $$$C$$$. Its rows and columns are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$R$$$ and $$$1$$$ to $$$C$$$, respectively.\n\nThe inhabitants of Chess Land are usually mentioned as pieces in everyday language, and there are $$$5$$$ specific types of them roaming the land: pawns, rooks, bishops, queens and kings. Contrary to popular belief, chivalry is long dead in Chess Land, so there are no knights to be found.\n\nEach piece is unique in the way it moves around from square to square: in one step,\n\n- a pawn can move one row forward (i.e. from row $$$r$$$ to $$$r+1$$$), without changing columns;\n- a rook can move any number of columns left/right without changing rows OR move any number of rows forward/backward without changing columns;\n- a bishop can move to any square of the two diagonals intersecting at its currently occupied square;\n- a queen can move to any square where a rook or a bishop could move to from her position;\n- and a king can move to any of the $$$8$$$ adjacent squares.\n\nRecently, Chess Land has become a dangerous place: pieces that are passing through the land can get captured unexpectedly by unknown forces and simply disappear. As a consequence, they would like to reach their destinations as fast (i.e. in as few moves) as possible, and they are also interested in the number of different ways it is possible for them to reach it, using the minimal number of steps \u2013 because more paths being available could mean lower chances of getting captured. Two paths are considered different if they differ in at least one visited square.\n\nFor this problem, let us assume that pieces are entering Chess Land in a given column of row $$$1$$$, and exit the land in a given column of row $$$R$$$. Your task is to answer $$$Q$$$ questions: given the type of a piece, the column it enters row $$$1$$$ and the column it must reach in row $$$R$$$ in order to exit, compute the minimal number of moves it has to make in Chess Land, and the number of different ways it is able to do so.\n\nInput Format:\nThe first line contains three space-separated integers $$$R$$$, $$$C$$$, and $$$Q$$$ $$$(1 \\leq Q \\leq 1000$$$, $$$2 \\leq C \\leq 1000$$$ and $$$C \\leq R \\leq 10^9)$$$ \u2013 the number of rows and columns of Chess Land, and the number of questions, respectively. Then $$$Q$$$ lines follow.\n\nEach line consists of\n\n- a character $$$T$$$, corresponding to the type of the piece in question ('P' for pawn, 'R' for rook, 'B' for bishop, 'Q' for queen and 'K' for king);\n- two integers $$$c_1$$$ and $$$c_R$$$, $$$1\\leq c_1,c_R\\leq C$$$, denoting that the piece starts from the $$$c_1$$$-th column of row $$$1$$$, and has to reach the $$$c_R$$$-th column of row $$$R$$$.\n\nOutput Format:\nYou have to print $$$Q$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th one containing two space separated integers, the answer to the $$$i$$$-th question: the first one is the minimal number of steps needed, the second is the number of different paths available using this number of steps. Since the answer can be quite large, you have to compute it modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.\n\nIf it is impossible to reach the target square, output the line \"0 0\"."}

{"prompt": "Programmer Vasya is studying a new programming language &K*. The &K* language resembles the languages of the C family in its syntax. However, it is more powerful, which is why the rules of the actual C-like languages are unapplicable to it. To fully understand the statement, please read the language's description below carefully and follow it and not the similar rules in real programming languages.\n\nThere is a very powerful system of pointers on &K* \u2014 you can add an asterisk to the right of the existing type X \u2014 that will result in new type X * . That is called pointer-definition operation. Also, there is the operation that does the opposite \u2014 to any type of X, which is a pointer, you can add an ampersand \u2014 that will result in a type &X, to which refers X. That is called a dereference operation.\n\nThe &K* language has only two basic data types \u2014 void and errtype. Also, the language has operators typedef and typeof.\n\n- The operator \"typedef A B\" defines a new data type B, which is equivalent to A. A can have asterisks and ampersands, and B cannot have them. For example, the operator typedef void** ptptvoid will create a new type ptptvoid, that can be used as void**.\n- The operator \"typeof A\" returns type of A, brought to void, that is, returns the type void**...*, equivalent to it with the necessary number of asterisks (the number can possibly be zero). That is, having defined the ptptvoid type, as shown above, the typeof ptptvoid operator will return void**.\n\nAn attempt of dereferencing of the void type will lead to an error: to a special data type errtype. For errtype the following equation holds true: errtype* = &errtype = errtype. An attempt to use the data type that hasn't been defined before that will also lead to the errtype.\n\nUsing typedef, we can define one type several times. Of all the definitions only the last one is valid. However, all the types that have been defined earlier using this type do not change.\n\nLet us also note that the dereference operation has the lower priority that the pointer operation, in other words &T *  is always equal to T.\n\nNote, that the operators are executed consecutively one by one.
